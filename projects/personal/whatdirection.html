<h1>What is it?</h1>
<div class="project-description">
	<p>WhatDirection is a simple app to get the "as the crow flies" direction to a destination. First, you pick a destination. Then, when you face that direction, the phone will vibrate.  There is a sensitivity meter to widen or shorten the range.</p>
</div>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<div class="project-description">
	<p>The app gathers two bearing coordinates. </br></br>The app gets your current location's longitude and latitude.  When you select a destination, the app retrieves the the longitude and latitude of the destination.  The app uses the haversine formula to convert both pairs of coordinates into a bearing.</br></br>The app then uses the phone's magnetometer to determine magnetic north in relation to your phone.  It converts the results of the magnetometer into a bearing.</br></br>The app then will buzz when the bearings are close, according to your sensitivity.  A stronger sensitivity simply shortens the window in which the two bearings are considered close.
